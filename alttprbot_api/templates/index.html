            <p>
                This website exists to provide a minimalistic interface to SahasrahBot's API. It is not meant to be a full-featured website.
                SahasrahBot also uses this website to provide a basic web interface for operations that are not possible (or difficult to implement) through Discord.
                Maybe someday I (Synack) will make a full-featured website for SahasrahBot, but for now this will have to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                This bot also has API endpoints that can be used to integrate SahasrahBot into other bots or websites.
                If you are interested in using SahasrahBot's API, please contact Synack#1337 on Discord or open an issue on SahasrahBot's Github.
