# SahasrahBot

This really wasn't meant to be publically viewable, but since people asked for the code here it is.

This is mostly here for transparency purposes, as this bot is responsible for rolling games for racing.  However, I cannot provide any support with setting this bot up locally or getting a local dev environment going.

Someday I'll migrate to a proper ORM and have a proper database migration setup.   Maybe then it'll be easier to then have feature flags so people can run this on their own.

If there's any feature within this bot that you'd like to use for your own project, feel free to use it within the terms of the license agreement attached.  I'd also be happy to make it a separate module, or add it to pyz3r, as well.

Thanks,

Thomas Prescott, aka Synack
